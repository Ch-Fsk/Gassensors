Each Subfolder in the siraj_airquality_project folder contains a datasheet and an excel file. 
Excel file has datapoints extracted from the sensitivity characteristics graph using webplotdigitizer app.
Log10 of the datapoints is calculated and the points are plotted using scattergraph option.
After obtaining the curve i have obtained the equations (both linear as well as non linear) using add trendline option .

Note:
Reason behind using Log function on the datapoints is to minimize the computational load on processor since plotting the data without using log function results in an exponential curve.
